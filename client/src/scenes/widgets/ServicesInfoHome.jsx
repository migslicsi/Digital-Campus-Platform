              Our vision is a society in which every student engages with social and environmental challenges during their time at university, empowering them to become active citizens: we do this by mainstreaming student social action, providing practical opportunities alongside training and skill development. We aim to reach students who otherwise wouldnâ€™t engage and empower them to become active citizens, so that they can achieve positive change now and after they graduate.
